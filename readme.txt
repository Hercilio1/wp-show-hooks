Show the origin of an action or filter hook sequentially which helps a developer to debug quickly.

== Description ==

A sequential and visual representation of WordPress action and filter hooks. Up until now, the way theme and plugin developers find where to hook into with their add_action() and add_filter() functions is either to search through the WordPress codebase or find a reference to the hook in the codex.

== Origin ==

We are proud the original base of the plugin was a fork of [Simply Show Hooks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-show-hooks/) as it has not been maintained for the last 6 years and has lots of compatibility issues. We have improved the code security and made it compatible with the latest WordPress.
